# ContractElementExtraction
Being a project done in partial fulfilment of COMP 5118 - Trends in Big Data Management (Winter 2020).


Project Goal: To use deep learnign technicques to extract contracts element by reproducing the work of Chalkidis, I., & Androutsopoulos, I. (2017). A Deep Learning Approach to Contract Element Extraction. JURIX.(http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/pubs/jurix2017.pdf).
